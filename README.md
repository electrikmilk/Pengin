# Pengin

This is my first attempt at a Social Network written in PHP with a basic front-end.

I made this during the pandemic as a distraction and hobby project. Hobby project as in I've always found the idea of doing a social network fun since I was young, and now that I have some idea of how to actually make one, I took a stab at it.

## Bad Security

Yeah...probably don't host this. I've learned a lot about PHP programming in the last two years since the pandemic started. Perhaps I'll make changes to this when I have the time to, so that this is more secure.

This is mainly here so that maybe others can learn from this project.
