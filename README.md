This is my first attempt at a Social Network written in PHP with a basic front-end. This code is from late 2020.

I made this during the pandemic as a distraction/hobby/learning project. Hobby project as in I've always found the idea of doing a social network fun since I was young, and now that I have some idea of how to actually make one, I took a stab at it. Learning project as in, I hadn't really done much sites outside of my job since I got my first tech job and I needed to start fresh to apply things I had learned, and also learn by doing.

## Now you've heard the good, here's the bad...and the ugly.

Yeah...probably don't host this unless you're ready to change how the accounts system works and how the database is accessed and fix a lot of bugs. I've learned a lot about PHP programming in the last two years since the pandemic started and alot of this would need a good redo for security and bugs. Perhaps I'll make changes to this when I have the time to, so that this is has more proper implementations.

This is mainly here so that maybe others can learn something from this version of the project.

If I do host this in the future, I'd likely take down this source for security reasons, but either way the database and accounts system would be rewritten entirely.

## Why not host this myself?

Obviously, maintaining a social network is a cumbersome undertaking, and I don't think I'm in the position to do that as one developer.
