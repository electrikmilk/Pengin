  <h2>Why does Pengin need to know my country and timezone?</h2>
  <p>We detect your country and timezone automatically when you create your account using your IP address.<br/>
    <br/>
    We use which country you live in to provide you with relevant content in the Discuss tab. We use your set timezone to show you accurate timestamps on posts, threads and more.<br/>
    <br/>
    Only you can see this info. You can change either of these at any time in your <a href='javascript:;' data-action='settings/localize'>localization settings</a>.</p>
