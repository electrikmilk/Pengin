  <blockquote>Pengin is a social media platform that gives you more control over your privacy and interactions with others. Public discussions are more like forums, regulated to user created threads within topics to keep conversations focused and less random so you can have less conversations with strangers who don't care about the topic of discussion.</blockquote>
  <br/>
  <h2>Focused global conversations</h2>
  <p>Public discussions are separated into topics, in each topic are user created threads. Create or join a public thread and have a conversation within the scope of that topic.</p>
  <p>This helps keep the conversation relegated to those interested in discussing it rather than total strangers.</p>
  <br/><h2>A Social Media Experience&mdash;Tailored by You, not the platform.</h2>
  <p>Other platforms seem to be fueled by unproductive conversations and an angry mob mentality. Our platform discourages this behavior by giving you more control over who you interact with.</p>
  <p>You tweak your experience to how you would like to interact with others. From only allowing those who don't follow you to see details you select, only allow follows or messages by request, to whether or not you see posts by mutuals and more. You control every level of privacy and interaction from people you know, mutuals, and total strangers.</p>
  <br/><h2>Respect for Privacy and Speech</h2>
  <p>We value your privacy and do not make any money off of your data. We only get the data from you we need to provide you with our service. We don't store data after you've deleted it and we never give it to the authorities unless you have posted illegal content.</p><p>Additionally, we are not motivated by any 3rd party or personal politics to remove posts, suspend you or ban you from the platform provided you follow our community guidelines.</p>
  <br/><h2>Time Limits</h2>
  <p>Unlike other platforms focused on social engineering, we have a built-in feature to set personal time limits to remind you to take a break.</p><p>Once you have your limit set, you'll be reminded on both our website and app to take a break. You can even be logged out of your account after your limit has been reached if you'd like.</p>Social media can be addictive, but that doesn't mean that platforms should encourage it.</p>
